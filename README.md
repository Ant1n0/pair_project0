Finished:
1. Choosing Google Cloud (GCP) as 载体:) It is at least me a person in this group (I certainly hope more people will come) the first time using the various GCP services.
2. Should we use Sprint Boot. Yes!
2. Maven vs Gradle vs our so many ide options... well what a nice thinking needed here (might). We need to understand everyone of these choices which is cool.
