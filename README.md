### This is a group project initiated by Oscar Ou and Ge Yu Feng. One day we talked about doing some side projects to help us learn more skills of CS (Computer Science) and CE (Computer Engineering). We are both students from the University of Waterloo.

### Welcome Liu Yi Jian!

### 1. isn't this diary style cool? we can use similar format also! :)
### 2. **everyone in the project is welcomed to edit this file!**
### 3. happy coding and good luck guys!
### 4. All languages welcome! Dutch, English, Chinese, Or Student, Studentin, Or...or...or...
### 5. There will be no lead person in this project I guess. We will be working as a whole to learn new skills, develop something useful for the world, and most importantly, ah... what is the most important again? Answer:
### 6. Most of the communications might be appearing in this read me file I am guessing, or there can be [option 1] [option 2] [option 3] (forms of communications). Yay :)
### 7. Useful links will be here and there. I hope our README.md file will be very responsive and actually it will eventually become our "documentation" for this project and maybe future projects:)

1. Choosing Google Cloud (GCP) as 载体:) It is at least me a person in this group (I certainly hope more people will come) the first time using the various GCP services.
2. Should we use Sprint Boot. I guess Yes?

3. I am thinking how we collab. Exciting! Let's go, IAM. Hey one of the Ops guy: **Fill your name if you WANT this role**?
4. Maven vs Gradle vs our so many ide options... well what a nice thinking needed here (might). We need to understand everyone of these choices which is cool.

[links of ides] Can we use any of good ides, any suggestions guys?

5. cute things i just met: 1. Error: Unable to access jarfile jython_installer-2.7.1.jar 2. E: Unable to locate package pip3-python
sloves:
```
sudo apt-get install python3-setuptools
sudo easy_install3 pip
pip --version
```
So now it looks like we are having python 3.5 and stuff
6. Current Structure in that machine is something like this:
```
_in home directory, type `ls`_:
a_explaination_file  data            logs                                   solr-6.5.1
apache-nutch-2.3.1   gs-spring-boot  mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu1604-3.4.7  src

- a_explaination_file, useless file, we can write something in it
- data, data, should be containing data now and future
- logs, logs, should be containing logs now and future
- solr-6.5.1, that is apache solr, a very stable search engine
- apache-nutch-2.3.1, apache nutch, don't know much about it but it is related to crawling data part of our project
- gs-spring-boot, somehow I don't remember the reason for this folder, but spring is spring
- mongodb-linux-x86_64-ubuntu1604-3.4.7, mongodb database i just set up for us guys! But Please feel free to add MySQL part installation in it, _do it do it:)_
```
