#### This is a group project initiated by Oscar Ou and Ge Yu Feng. One day we talked about doing some side projects to help us learn more skills of CS (Computer Science) and CE (Computer Engineering). We are both students from the University of Waterloo.

Finished:
1. Choosing Google Cloud (GCP) as 载体:) It is at least me a person in this group (I certainly hope more people will come) the first time using the various GCP services.
2. Should we use Sprint Boot. I guess Yes?

3. I am thinking how we collab. Exciting! Let's go, IAM. Hey one of the Ops guy: **Fill your name if you WANT this role**?
4. Maven vs Gradle vs our so many ide options... well what a nice thinking needed here (might). We need to understand everyone of these choices which is cool.
