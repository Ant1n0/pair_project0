Finished:
1. Choosing Google Cloud (GCP) as 载体:) It is at least me a person in this group (I certainly hope more people will come) the first time using the various GCP services.
2. Should we use Sprint Boot. I guess Yes?
3. I am thinking how we collab. Exciting! Let's go, IAM. Hey one of the Ops guy @Ahbi
2. Maven vs Gradle vs our so many ide options... well what a nice thinking needed here (might). We need to understand everyone of these choices which is cool.
